# Visio_DPPT
## Visio_Data Pre-Processing Tools

### The following branches are the modified pre-processing tools used by VisioAccelerAI.
For Context: VisioAccelerAI is a capstone project. Its main goal is to inference a facial recognition system into an FPGA board to boost the computational capability of the model to have its application of real-time attendance monitoring system.
