# Visio_DPPT (Visio_Data Pre-Processing Tools)

## The following branches are the modified pre-processing tools used by VisioAccelerAI.
VisioAccelerAI is a capstone project. Its main goal is to inference a facial recognition system into an FPGA board to boost the computational capability of the model to have its application of real-time attendance monitoring system. But for this repository, it is the tools used to prepare datasets before training the model.

## Just follow the steps from the readMe section of each brnahces.

# Visio_Augmentor
- This branch is used to augment the collected data, it uses the python library "Augmentor". Feel free to explore the other functions of this library. For now, the script.py is used to augment several datasets used in the project.

# Visio_Labelling-Automation
## This branch has two purpose:
- First is to collect data aumatically using a webcam in real-time and automates to label the collected data.
-  Second is to automate  labelling of your exising collected datasets.
