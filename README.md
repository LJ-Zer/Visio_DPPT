# Visio_Dataset-Splitter
- This branch is used to split the datasets to train, test, validation. Follow the steps in the Visio_Dataset-Splitter branch.

# FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT!
- I recommend to edit the dataset-splitter.py by using args to call the functions and folders in terminal. For now, just locate the and edit the script on where you can locate your folders.

# Open File dataset_splitter.py
- change directory of the train, test, validation and dataset locations

# Run script
- python dataset_splitter.py
